	Geoinformatics is an informatics field that draws its inputs from geography, cartography, GIS, geodesy, remote sensing, photogrammetry and GPS. 
	It aims at addressing the problems of any discipline within a geographical context.
	
	1. GIS: The Geographic Information System (GIS) consists of storge, display and analysis of 
	any georeferenced spatial data. In flood modelling, the various data can be topography (DTM), 
	river survey, drainage network, rainfall, runoff and structures.
	
	There are a variety of GIS tools:
	<ol>
	<li>ArcGIS</li>
	<li>QGIS</li>
	<li>MapInfo</li>
	</ol>
	
	2. Geodesy (Surveying): Surveying is the science and art of determining the relative positions of points above, 
	on, or beneath the earthâ€™s surface and locating the points in the field.

	3. Remote sensing: It is an art and science of obtaining information about an object or feature without physically 
	coming in contact with that object or feature. Humans apply remote sensing in their day-to-day business, through 
	vision, hearing and sense of smell. 
	
	4. Global Positioning System (GPS): A satellite navigation system used to determine the ground position of an object. 
	GPS technology was first used by the United States military in the 1960s and expanded into civilian use over 
	the next few decades. Today, GPS receivers are included in many commercial products, such as automobiles, 
	smartphones, exercise watches, and GIS devices.
